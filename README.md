# Car-Price-Predictor
Numerous regression models are built using R for the purpose of predicting car price. Methods are compared through model assessment in order to select the optimal model. The superior model from the set is shown to be a random forest with few features, allowing for a relatively simple model that yields predictions with high accuracy.

In addition a dashboard created through Power BI is provided to display the characteristics of the outliers, and instances where the model behaves uniquely based on the factor of qualitative variables.
